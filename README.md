This is a game created for the Software Design and Development class at Macalester College, Spring semester 2016.
It is a sandbox kind of game. You can build your own bridge and then burn it down! Enjoy it!


### How to download, build and run the project

We used [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/index.html) to develop our game.
They have great documentation in the webpage on how to build a libGDX project in different IDEs and in the command line.
